Before going to analyse our data we need to go to the folder in which the file has reside.
In my case it was in "gtk678"

-- cd gtk678
-- ls

You can observe the file under gtk678.

Now on same folder type a command "hive" 

You can observe a command shell there.

Basic commands in Hive -- mostly same as SQL
	
-- creating database ==> CREATE DATABASE <name>;
-- creating table ==> CREATE TABLE <name> ( <attribute list> );
-- Showing databases ==> SHOW databases;
-- Showing tables ==> SHOW tables;
-- Dropping database ==> DROP database <name>;
-- Dropping table ==> DROP table <name>;
-- select query ==> SELECT * FROM <table name>;
